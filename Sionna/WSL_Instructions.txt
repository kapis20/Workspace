# How to Use WSL and Open it Through VS Code

## Step 1: Launch WSL
1. Open Windows Terminal or PowerShell.
2. Type the following command to start WSL:
   ```
   wsl
   ```
3. This will open the default WSL distribution (e.g., Ubuntu). If you have multiple distributions installed, specify the distribution name:
   ```
   wsl -d Ubuntu
   ```

## Step 2: Open a Folder in Visual Studio Code Using WSL
1. Navigate to your project directory in WSL using the `cd` command:
   ```
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```
2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code using the `code .` command:
   ```
   code .
   ```
   This will open the current WSL directory in Visual Studio Code.

## Step 3: Working with Git in WSL
1. Make sure you're in your project's directory.
2. Run the following commands to manage your repository:
   - **Check status**: `git status`
   - **Stage changes**: `git add .`
   - **Commit changes**: `git commit -m "Your commit message"`
   - **Push to GitHub**: `git push`

## Step 4: Closing WSL
1. To exit WSL, simply type `exit` and press `Enter`.
