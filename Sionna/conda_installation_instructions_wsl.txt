# How to Install Conda on WSL

## Step 1: Open WSL Terminal
Start by launching your WSL terminal. You can open it through the Windows Start Menu or use any installed WSL distributions (e.g., Ubuntu).

## Step 2: Download the Anaconda Installer
Navigate to the official Anaconda download page (https://www.anaconda.com/download) from your browser and select the Linux version of the installer. Alternatively, you can download it directly in your WSL terminal using the following command:

```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2023.09-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

> Tip: The version in the URL (Anaconda3-2023.09-1-Linux-x86_64.sh) may change over time. Always check the latest Anaconda releases.

## Step 3: Run the Anaconda Installer
After downloading, run the installer script using the `bash` command:

```bash
bash Anaconda3-2023.09-1-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. This will include reading the license, choosing the installation path, and deciding whether to initialize Conda by running `conda init` at the end of the process.

## Step 4: Initialize Conda
If you didn’t choose to initialize Conda during the installation, run the following command to manually initialize it:

```bash
conda init
```

This will modify your `~/.bashrc` file to include Conda’s path and configurations.

## Step 5: Restart the Terminal
Close your WSL terminal and reopen it to activate the changes made by `conda init`.

## Step 6: Verify the Conda Installation
Check if Conda is installed and working correctly by running:

```bash
conda --version
```

You should see an output displaying the version of Conda installed, e.g., `conda 24.5.0`.

## Step 7: Optional - Create and Manage Virtual Environments
To create a new Conda environment, use:

```bash
conda create --name myenv
```

To activate your environment, use:

```bash
conda activate myenv
```

To deactivate, simply run:

```bash
conda deactivate
```

## Step 8: Verify PATH and Configuration (If Needed)
If you encounter issues with the `conda` command not being found after installation, ensure the Conda path is correctly set. You can manually add Conda to your PATH by editing the `.bashrc` file:

1. Open `.bashrc`:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

2. Add the following line at the end:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/anaconda3/bin:$PATH"
```

3. Save the file and source it:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

This should resolve any `command not found` issues.

## Step 9: Update Conda
To keep Conda up to date, run:

```bash
conda update conda
```

This completes the installation process for Conda on WSL.
