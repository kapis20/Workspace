# Instructions to Copy Conda Environment Using environment.yml

## Step 1: Export the Environment
On the source machine (e.g., your personal PC), export the environment to a `yml` file:
```
conda activate <your_env_name>
conda env export > environment.yml
```

## Step 2: Add the environment.yml File to Your Repository
- Navigate to your repository directory:
```
cd <your_repo_directory>
```
- Add the file to your repository and commit it:
```
git add environment.yml
git commit -m "Add environment.yml for environment replication"
git push origin main
```

## Step 3: Clone the Repository on the Target Machine
On the target machine (e.g., your WSL environment), clone the repository if you haven't already:
```
git clone <your_repo_url>
cd <your_repo_directory>
```

## Step 4: Create the Environment Using environment.yml
Navigate to the directory containing the `environment.yml` file, then run:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Step 5: Activate the New Environment
Activate the environment by using:
```
conda activate <your_env_name>
```

## Step 6: Verify the Installation
Check if all required packages are installed by running:
```
conda list
```

# Troubleshooting
- **File Not Found Error:** Ensure the `environment.yml` file is in the directory where you're running the command.
- **Typo in Filename:** Double-check that the filename is `environment.yml` (not `enviroment.yml` or similar).

That's it! You have successfully copied the environment to your new machine.
